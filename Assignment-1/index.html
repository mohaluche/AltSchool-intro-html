<h2> Biography </h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Moha Luche Zewude. I'm from East Africa, Ethiopia, and I am currently enrolled in the School of Engineering
     at Alt School Africa as a Frontend Engineering student. When I was in high school, I felt like I should study software engineering.
     However, after finishing preparatory school and joining university, I couldn't pursue my wish because I was assigned to a different
     program, and my university didnâ€™t offer this program. With a deep passion for software engineering and technology, I am eager to 
     develop my skills in web development and create impactful, user-friendly digital solutions. I believe this program provides the 
     perfect environment to learn, grow, and work on real-world projects that will take my wishes to the next level.
